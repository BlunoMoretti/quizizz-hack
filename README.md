# Quizizz Hack
## Bookmarklet
`javascript:fetch('https://thatfrueddued.github.io/quizizz-hack/Quizizz.js').then(function(response){response.text().then(function(text){eval(text);});});`  

Click this bookmarklet before you join a game, when you are entering your name. Then, press the w key to automatically answer. This does not currently work on mobile, but support is coming soon. Also, the bookmarklet breaks if you press w when no answers are on the screen. This will also be fixed in an upcoming update.

## Reactivating Bookmarklet

If the bookmarklet breaks in the middle of a game, reload the page. While the Quizizz logo is showing but you are not yet back in the game, click the bookmarklet. This should reactivate it if anything breaks.

## Upcoming Features

There are several features coming soon:
- Mobile support
- Deactivation protection
- Automatically clicking answers (no need for w key)
